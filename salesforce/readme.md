## Features

- Multi-threaded processing for improved performance
- Fetches accounts updated within the last 24 hours
- Includes related Salesforce objects (Contacts, Opportunities, Cases)
- Supports both username-password and OAuth 2.0 authentication with Salesforce
- Upserts data to Dust datasources
- Passing the env variable `IMPORT_AS_TABLE` will also save accounts in a structured tables in Dust.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or higher recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Salesforce account with API access
- Dust account with API access

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/salesforce-to-dust-import.git
   cd salesforce-to-dust-import
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

   ```
   SF_LOGIN_URL=https://login.salesforce.com
   SF_USERNAME=your_salesforce_username
   SF_PASSWORD=your_salesforce_password
   SF_SECURITY_TOKEN=your_salesforce_security_token
   SF_CLIENT_ID=your_salesforce_client_id
   SF_CLIENT_SECRET=your_salesforce_client_secret
   DUST_API_KEY=your_dust_api_key
   DUST_WORKSPACE_ID=your_dust_workspace_id
   DUST_DATASOURCE_ID_SALESFORCE=your_dust_datasource_id
   ```

   Note: You can use either username-password authentication (SF_USERNAME, SF_PASSWORD, SF_SECURITY_TOKEN) or OAuth 2.0 (SF_CLIENT_ID, SF_CLIENT_SECRET) for Salesforce.

## Usage

To run the script:

```
npm run accounts
```

This command will execute the `sfdc-accounts-to-dust.ts` script using ts-node.

## Configuration

You can adjust the following variables in the script:

- `UPDATED_SINCE`: Change the time range for fetching updated accounts (default is last 24 hours)
- `THREADS_NUMBER`: Adjust the number of worker threads (default is 5)

## How It Works

1. The script connects to Salesforce using the provided credentials.
2. It fetches IDs of accounts that have been updated in the last 24 hours, including accounts with updated contacts, opportunities, or cases.
3. Detailed information for these accounts is retrieved from Salesforce, including related objects.
4. The accounts are divided into batches and processed by multiple worker threads.
5. Each account's information is formatted into a structured text document.
6. The formatted documents are upserted to the specified Dust datasource.

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling for various scenarios:

- Connection errors with Salesforce or Dust API
- Query execution errors
- Data processing errors

Errors are logged to the console for debugging purposes.

## Linting

To run the linter:

```
npm run lint
```

## Building

To compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

```
npm run build
```
